        My name is Ryan Goodfellow. I'm an engineer at the 
        <a href="https://oxide.computer">Oxide Computer Company</a>. 
        My work focuses on networking at the hardware/software interface on the 
        <a href="https://illumos.org">illumos</a>
        operating system. Specific areas of interest include routing protocols, 
        operating system network architecture, network testbeds and emulation.

    <h2> Tinkering </h2>
    <p>
    Tinkering is the process of learning by experimentation. Poking at things
    to see how they respond. Collecting observations to build higher level
    understanding and peeling back layers of complexity to build deeper
    understanding. When combined with open-source systems, tinkering becomes
    an even more powerful tool for building knowledge. This series of posts
    explores networking systems through tinkering and source code.

    <h2> Architecture </h2>
    <p>
    Architecture is what allows complex systems to evolve and maintain stability
    at the same time. At Oxide, we're working on building open systems beyond
    the traditional network black-box function boundaries. These efforts are
    revealing a fully programmable data plane which, presents new complexities
    that must be approached at the operating system network architecture level
    to be successful. This series of posts explores the opportunities in this
    space.
